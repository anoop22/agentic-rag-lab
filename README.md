# Agentic RAG Demo

This repository contains a single-file version of LangGraph's Agentic RAG tutorial.

## Running

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and run `agentic_rag.py`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
python agentic_rag.py
```

The script streams updates from the agent as it answers a demo question.
